# WEDE-Assignment-part-two
In this repositry, is the updated website and all the changes implemented.
such as the implementation/use of css to modify and enhance the website appearance. With the css, I've included a background image for the entire website, and also included the use of elements for each section of the website. I changed the navigation links to a list-style of none and changed its display to flex. The logo for the website has also been changed to a new logo
For the Shop section, I have also used css to create a table with subcategories to make it easier for users to shop and browse our catalogue without getting mixed up of where to find each clothing they are looking for. Also updated the catalogue options to new options
